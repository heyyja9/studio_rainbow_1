            <h2 class="history-heading">Brand History</h2>
            <p class="history-description">
                The idea for Rainbow Loom was conceived in 2010 by Cheong Choon Ng, 
                a Malaysian immigrant and mechanical engineer working for Nissan. 
                Inspired by his daughters, Teresa and Michelle, making rubber band 
                bracelets, and hindered by his larger fingers, Ng built a wooden 
                push-pin board to improve his dexterity. Although the initial, 
                bulkier design didn't win his daughters over, he refined it by 
                adding more rows of push pins, eventually capturing their interest. <br><br>

                Teresa, his oldest daughter, later suggested he manufacture and sell 
                the loom, and his brother Cheong Yeow Ng encouraged him to market it 
                online. Leveraging his background in product design, quality control, 
                and manufacturing, Ng and his family invested $10 000 in Chinese 
                manufacturers, dividing $5000 for molding the template, and $5000 
                for the kit's parts. In the summer of 2011, a 2000 pound shipment 
                of rubber bands arrived, and Ng began assembling the kits at night 
                after work, while his wife, Tyng Fen Chan, worked on them during the day. <br><br>

                After early sales were hampered by customer confusion over the 
                innovative toy, Ng and his daughters began posting instructional 
                YouTube videos to educate potential buyers. These videos proved 
                pivotal, as in summer 2012, a Learning Express Toys store (a chain 
                of 130 franchises) ordered 24 looms, and called to reorder just two 
                days later. Soon, other locations rushed to stock up, and by summer 
                2013, Rainbow Loom was listed as one of the chain's top toys. <br><br>

                As of August 2013, Ng manages a team of 12 from a 7500-square-foot 
                warehouse near his home, handling distribution while manufacturing 
                occurs in China. In all, Rainbow Loom is carried by 600 retailers, 
                with sales exceeding just over one million units at retail prices 
                between $15 and $17. <br><br>

            <h2 class="craze-heading">The Bracelet Craze</h2>
            <p class="craze-description">
                The owner of a Learning Express Toys in Chattanooga, Mary Beth 
                Conklin, states that Rainbow Loom's popularity has exceeded 
                that of past hits like Webkinz and Silly Bandz. <br><br>

                Conklin, whose store began selling Rainbow Loom kits in October 
                2012, shares that “Rainbow Loom far exceeds those trends. 
                We've been in business five years and we've never carried 
                anything as popular.” She believes that the product has 
                become a social phenomenon because “kids love trading the 
                bracelets. [...] [They] find great satisfaction in being 
                challenged by the endless number of designs they can make.” 
                She goes on to explain how parents have even hopped on the trend 
                as “it's educational and enhances fine motor skills, [...]  
                [and] gets kids off the iPads, iTouches, and all things electronic.” <br><br>

                Similarly, Jeff Underwood, a district manager for the crafts store 
                Michaels, mentions that the Rainbow Loom kits have been highly 
                popular at their locations. He says, “The first day that we 
                introduced the Rainbow Loom, we had more than 20 Michaels 
                sold out immediately.” <br><br>
